## üöÄ How to Register Your Team

To participate in the Forte Hacks Leaderbaord and start earning points, you need to register your team in the `registry.yaml` file.

### üìã Registration Requirements

Your team's projects must meet **at least one** of the following criteria:

2. **With Flow Components** - Your projects use:
   - Cadence Language
   - `@onflow/fcl` or `@onflow/react-sdk` (in package.json)
   - Go SDK (URL in go.mod)
   - Flow public EVM endpoints (in Solidity configuration files)

### üìù Registration Template

Copy the following structure, modify it to your needs, and add it to the end of `registry.yaml`:

```yaml

    - username1
    - username2

    # Your team's repositories - all commits to these repos will be tracked
    - https://github.com/your/repo_1

    # Your team's wallets to accept Flow Rewards

    flow: "0x0000000000000001"
